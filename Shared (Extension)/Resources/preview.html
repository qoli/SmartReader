        aid into Gaza from the sky is fast becoming a last resort way to get food
        to starving peopleOne thousand miles east of Gaza, large blocks of aid are
        being loaded on to a US military transport plane, its crew silhouetted by
        the morning sun glancing over the desert landscape around Qatar's al-Udeid
        airbase.They push 80 crates into the plane's cavernous interior, each
        canvas-wrapped block strapped to a cardboard pallet and topped with a
        parachute.Feeding Gaza is now a complex, risky, multi-national operation.
        The RAF carried out its first two aid flights this week. France, Germany,
        Jordan, Egypt and the UAE have also been taking part.This was the 18th
        mission flown by US forces. Dropping 40,000 ready-prepared meals into the
        tiny, besieged war-zone requires them to make a six-hour round trip from
        Doha.It is more expensive and less efficient than other ways of delivering
        aid and it is also harder to control. Earlier this week, 12 people are
        thought to have drowned while trying to retrieve aid parcels that fell
        into the sea. Another six were reportedly crushed in the stampede to reach
        it. "We're very aware of all the news, and we're trying to limit
        casualties," said Maj Boone, the mission commander, standing beneath a
        large American flag at the entrance to the cockpit."[We're doing]
        literally everything we can. We use a chute that falls at a slower rate to
        give Gazans more time to see the parachute and get out of the way. BBC
        News went onboard an aid flight to see a US drop taking place over Gaza"We
        also have assets overhead that clear the drop zone, so we won't drop if
        there's any group of people there."He said they mapped the route
        carefully, aiming to land the aid in safer, open spaces along the Gaza
        coast, but drop the parcels over the sea so that crates with
        malfunctioning parachutes would drop into the water, rather than on
        buildings or people.None of that is easy.A heavy military cargo plane can
        be heard for miles around, meaning crowds quickly gather to follow
        it.Desperation leads many to take enormous risks to retrieve the aid - and
        many come away with nothing.Hamas has reportedly demanded a halt to air
        drops as casualties have grown, calling them "useless" and a "real danger
        to the lives of hungry civilians".The risks are increased by the lack of
        any organised distribution of the aid once it hits the ground.As we swing
        down low over Gaza, the plane ramp opens to reveal the outskirts of the
        Strip's devastated capital city - its remaining tower blocks jutting up
        like lone naked teeth.American food parcels are being targeted at places
        where American-made weapons have already made their mark.The roads beneath
        us along the coast were busy with people and vehicles, moving quickly in
        the same direction, apparently racing the plane.ReutersThe US military has
        issued images of the planes it uses to transport the aid packagesWe
        watched as the parachutes slipped quickly out, shrinking to specks in
        seconds. Many hung over the water - but two, their parachutes stalled,
        crashed straight into the sea."It's not perfect," said US Air Force
        spokesman Maj Ryan DeCamp when asked whether aid drops were the best
        approach to Gaza's hunger crisis."We know there's upwards of two million
        people who need food on the ground - innocent civilians who did not ask
        for this conflict - and we're dropping meals in the tens of
        thousands."Does it feel like a drop in the bucket? Maybe a little bit -
        but if you're a family on the ground who got some of this aid, it can be a
        lifesaver."On the ground in Gaza, a journalist working with the BBC
        watched the US parachutes fall. He counted 11 air drops that day. Some
        residents in northern areas reportedly spend their days watching the skies
        for aid planes.Gaza starvation could amount to war crime, UN human rights
        chief tells BBC"We have tried twice this morning, but in vain," said
        another Gaza City resident, Ahmed Tafesh. "If we can at least get a can of
        beans or hummus to support ourselves, we hope we will eat today. Hunger
        has consumed most people, they have no energy anymore."A recent global
        assessment warned of imminent famine in Gaza, prompting the UN's top court
        this week to order Israel to enable an immediate "unhindered" flow of
        aid."If people are starving and we're giving them food, that's the best we
        can do right now," said Maj Boone."I know other people are trying
        [approaches] that take more time. My team of C17s were notified and out
        here within 36 hours and doing everything in our potential to get food to
        people who need it."Watch: Gazans reportedly drown after video shows rush
        for aid drop that landed in seaIsrael has rejected both the famine
        assessment and the UN court order, saying allegations that it is blocking
        aid are "wholly unfounded". It has accused Hamas of stealing aid.But
        humanitarian aid for Gaza is one of the issues dividing the US and Israel
        over this war at the moment.The US is building a temporary pier in Gaza to
        get more aid in quickly. Israel's busiest cargo port, 48km (30 miles) from
        Gaza City, has not been opened for aid. US President Joe Biden has been
        pressing Israel's prime minister hard to expand access for land convoys -
        still the best way of getting large amounts of aid in quickly.Scenes of
        sick, malnourished children dying in Gazan hospitals are shifting
        electoral politics in America, but he has so far been unwilling to use US
        arms supplies as leverage to drive his demand home.Aid flights are
        multiplying among Arab and western nations. Risky and inefficient, they
        drop small amounts of food into a desperate population. They are an
        eye-catching last resort.Their value is measured in two simple questions:
        how much do they ease the pressure on Gaza's population and how much do
        they ease the pressure on governments elsewhere? (content.js, line 42)3

        hours agoBy Lucy Williamson,BBC News, above the Gaza StripEPADropping aid
        into Gaza from the sky is fast becoming a last resort way to get food to
        starving peopleOne thousand miles east of Gaza, large blocks of aid are
        being loaded on to a US military transport plane, its crew silhouetted by
        the morning sun glancing over the desert landscape around Qatar's al-Udeid
        airbase.They push 80 crates into the plane's cavernous interior, each
        canvas-wrapped block strapped to a cardboard pallet and topped with a
        parachute.Feeding Gaza is now a complex, risky, multi-national operation.
        The RAF carried out its first two aid flights this week. France, Germany,
        Jordan, Egypt and the UAE have also been taking part.This was the 18th
        mission flown by US forces. Dropping 40,000 ready-prepared meals into the
        tiny, besieged war-zone requires them to make a six-hour round trip from
        Doha.It is more expensive and less efficient than other ways of delivering
        aid and it is also harder to control. Earlier this week, 12 people are
        thought to have drowned while trying to retrieve aid parcels that fell
        into the sea. Another six were reportedly crushed in the stampede to reach
        it. "We're very aware of all the news, and we're trying to limit
        casualties," said Maj Boone, the mission commander, standing beneath a
        large American flag at the entrance to the cockpit."[We're doing]
        literally everything we can. We use a chute that falls at a slower rate to
        give Gazans more time to see the parachute and get out of the way. BBC
        News went onboard an aid flight to see a US drop taking place over Gaza"We
        also have assets overhead that clear the drop zone, so we won't drop if
        there's any group of people there."He said they mapped the route
        carefully, aiming to land the aid in safer, open spaces along the Gaza
        coast, but drop the parcels over the sea so that crates with
        malfunctioning parachutes would drop into the water, rather than on
        buildings or people.None of that is easy.A heavy military cargo plane can
        be heard for miles around, meaning crowds quickly gather to follow
        it.Desperation leads many to take enormous risks to retrieve the aid - and
        many come away with nothing.Hamas has reportedly demanded a halt to air
        drops as casualties have grown, calling them "useless" and a "real danger
        to the lives of hungry civilians".The risks are increased by the lack of
        any organised distribution of the aid once it hits the ground.As we swing
        down low over Gaza, the plane ramp opens to reveal the outskirts of the
        Strip's devastated capital city - its remaining tower blocks jutting up
        like lone naked teeth.American food parcels are being targeted at places
        where American-made weapons have already made their mark.The roads beneath
        us along the coast were busy with people and vehicles, moving quickly in
        the same direction, apparently racing the plane.ReutersThe US military has
        issued images of the planes it uses to transport the aid packagesWe
        watched as the parachutes slipped quickly out, shrinking to specks in
        seconds. Many hung over the water - but two, their parachutes stalled,
        crashed straight into the sea."It's not perfect," said US Air Force
        spokesman Maj Ryan DeCamp when asked whether aid drops were the best
        approach to Gaza's hunger crisis."We know there's upwards of two million
        people who need food on the ground - innocent civilians who did not ask
        for this conflict - and we're dropping meals in the tens of
        thousands."Does it feel like a drop in the bucket? Maybe a little bit -
        but if you're a family on the ground who got some of this aid, it can be a
        lifesaver."On the ground in Gaza, a journalist working with the BBC
        watched the US parachutes fall. He counted 11 air drops that day. Some
        residents in northern areas reportedly spend their days watching the skies
        for aid planes.Gaza starvation could amount to war crime, UN human rights
        chief tells BBC"We have tried twice this morning, but in vain," said
        another Gaza City resident, Ahmed Tafesh. "If we can at least get a can of
        beans or hummus to support ourselves, we hope we will eat today. Hunger
        has consumed most people, they have no energy anymore."A recent global
        assessment warned of imminent famine in Gaza, prompting the UN's top court
        this week to order Israel to enable an immediate "unhindered" flow of
        aid."If people are starving and we're giving them food, that's the best we
        can do right now," said Maj Boone."I know other people are trying
        [approaches] that take more time. My team of C17s were notified and out
        here within 36 hours and doing everything in our potential to get food to
        people who need it."Watch: Gazans reportedly drown after video shows rush

        assessment and the UN court order, saying allegations that it is blocking
        aid are "wholly unfounded". It has accused Hamas of stealing aid.But
        humanitarian aid for Gaza is one of the issues dividing the US and Israel
        over this war at the moment.The US is building a temporary pier in Gaza to
        get more aid in quickly. Israel's busiest cargo port, 48km (30 miles) from
        Gaza City, has not been opened for aid. US President Joe Biden has been
        pressing Israel's prime minister hard to expand access for land convoys -
        still the best way of getting large amounts of aid in quickly.Scenes of
        sick, malnourished children dying in Gazan hospitals are shifting
        electoral politics in America, but he has so far been unwilling to use US
